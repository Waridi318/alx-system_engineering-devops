A server is a physical or virtual machine that hosts the entire web infrastructure. It is responsible for running the necessary software and services.

The domain name allows users to easily reach the website without needing to remember its IP address.

www.foobar.com is a CNAME DNS record type. The www.foobar.com maps to the
main domain foobar.com

The web server serves the static pages of the website www.foobar.com

The application server serves the dynamic pages of the website

The database stores files and extra information needed by our website

the server is using http protocol to receive requests from the client and send back responses

SPOF- Downtime, incase server fails, since there is no redundancy
    - Over load on the server in case of multiple clients
    - Security since we dont have any firewalls to check incoming data

Downtime when maintenance needed (like deploying new code web server needs to be restarted) since we have only 1 server design
