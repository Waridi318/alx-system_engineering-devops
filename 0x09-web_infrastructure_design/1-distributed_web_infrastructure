I have added 2 servers to provide for redundancy and efficiency in case one is down
The load balancer balances traffic to and from the servers to clients
I've used active passive setup, such that, 1 server is active, the other 2 being on stand-by in case the other active one fails

A database Primary-Replica cluster: The primary dbs acts as the main dbs, the replica one being on stand by incase of failure

SPOF - SPOF are reduced in this infrastructure, since it provides for redundancy
    - Security issues since we don't have firewalls to check for incoming data
    - Our infrastructure is not being monitored hence, failure in the system may not be quickly and easily detected
